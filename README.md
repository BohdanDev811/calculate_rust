Running the Simple Calculator in Rust
This guide explains how to clone and run the provided simple calculator code written in Rust.

Prerequisites:

Rust compiler: Download and install Rust from the official website https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
Terminal: You'll need a terminal window to navigate your directories and run commands.
Steps:

Clone the Repository (Optional):

If you have the code hosted on a platform like GitHub, you can clone it using a Git client. Here's an example assuming you have Git installed:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/BohdanDev811/calculator_rust.git 
Use code with caution.


Create a New Project (If not using a repository):

If you don't have the code in a repository, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal:

Bash
``mkdir calculator && cd calculator``
Use code with caution.
Create the Files:

Create two files named ``main.rs`` and math.rs within the calculator directory. Paste the code for main.rs and math.rs provided earlier into their respective files.

Run the Program:

Open your terminal inside the project directory (where main.rs and math.rs reside). Run the following command to compile and execute the program:

Bash
``cargo run``
Use code with caution.
Cargo, Rust's package manager, will handle building and running the program.

Using the Calculator:

The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /). Enter the values and press Enter after each input. The program will then display the calculation result.

Additional Notes:

Ensure you have a stable internet connection if cloning a repository.
This is a basic example. You can modify the code to add more features or functionalities.
Refer to the Rust documentation https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/ for a deeper understanding of the language and concepts used in the code.
